# HTML FORMS 

## How a form works

We need to supply the form element with both the location of where the formâ€˜s information goes and what HTTP request to make
``` html
<form action="/example.html" method="POST">
</form>
```
1. The action attribute determines where the information is sent.
2. The method attribute is assigned a HTTP verb that is included in the HTTP request.

``` html
<form action="/practice.html" method="POST">
    <h1>Burgers</h1>
    <p>Feedback is important to us</p>
</form>
```



## text input 
The `<input>` element has a type attribute which determines how it renders on the web page and what kind of data it can accept.
