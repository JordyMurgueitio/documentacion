// DESTRUCTURING - is a JavaScript feature that makes it easier to extract data from arrays and objects



// 1. Destructuring Arrays

/* If we wanted to access these cars individually and assign them to variables 
We can use destructuring to shorten our code and make it more concise:*/
let cars = ['ferrari', 'tesla', 'cadillac'];
let [car1, car2, car3] = cars; 

console.log(car1, car2, car3);  // Prints: ferrari tesla cadillac
