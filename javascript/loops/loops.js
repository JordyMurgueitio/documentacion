// LOOPS - repeats a set of instructions until a specified condition, called a stopping condition is reached



// 1. The For loop -  The iterator variable is initialized, checked against the stopping condition, and assigned a new value on each loop iteration

// initialization is let count = 5, so the loop will start counting at 5.
// stopping condition is count < 11, the loop will run as long as the iterator variable, count, is less than 4.
// iteration statement is count++. after each loop, the value of count will increase by 1

for (let count = 5; count < 11; count++) {
    console.log(count);  // logs 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
}



// 2. Looping in reverse
