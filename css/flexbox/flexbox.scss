// FLEXBOX  


// 1. Display: flex 
// For an element to become a flex container, its display property must be set to flex.
// A div with the declaration display: flex; will remain block level — no other elements will appear on the same line as i

.container {
    display: flex;
}


// 2. Display: inline-flex
// If we didn’t want div elements to be block-level elements, we would use display: inline-flex

.container2 {
    width: 200px;
}

.child {
    display: inline-flex;
    width: 150px;
    height: auto;
}
// In the example above, the .child divs will take up more width (300 pixels) than the container div allows (200 pixels). 
// The .child divs will shrink to accommodate the container’s size



// 3. justify-content
// To position the items from left to right, we use justify-content

.container3 {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: flex-end;   // This will cause all of the flex items to shift to the right side of the flex container
    justify-content: flex-start; // all items will be positioned in order, starting from the left of the parent container
    justify-content: center; // all items will be positioned in order, in the center of the parent container
    justify-content: space-around;  // items will be positioned with equal space before and after each item, resulting in double space between elements
    justify-content: space-between; // items will be positioned with equal space between them, but no extra space before the first or after the last elements
}



// 4. align-items 
// It is possible to align flex items vertically within the container. The align-items property makes it possible to space flex items vertically.
// Works when theres is only 1 row
.container4 {
    display: flex;
    align-items: flex-end;  // all elements will be positioned at the bottom of the parent container.
    align-items: flex-start;  //all elements will be positioned at the top of the parent container
    align-items: center;  //the center of all elements will be positioned halfway between the top and bottom of the parent container.
    align-items: baseline;  //the bottom of the content of all items will be aligned with each other.
    align-items: stretch; //if possible, the items will stretch from top to bottom of the container (this is the default value; elements with a specified height will not stretch; elements with a minimum height or no height specified will stretch).
}


// 5. flex-wrap 
// we might want flex items to move to the next line when necessary.
.container {
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    flex-wrap: nowrap;
    flex-wrap: wrap-reverse;
}


// align-content  - declared on flex containers.
//If a container has multiple rows of content, we can use align-content to space the rows from top to bottom.
.container {
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    align-content: flex-start;
    align-content: flex-end;
    align-content: center;
    align-content: space-between;
    align-content: space-around;
    align-content: stretch;
}


// flex-direction - declared on flex containers.
.container { 
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    flex-direction: row;  // elements will be positioned from left to right across the parent element
    flex-direction: row-reverse;  // elements will be positioned from right to left across the parent element
    flex-direction: column; // elements will be positioned from top to bottom of the parent element
    flex-direction: column-reverse; // elements will be positioned from the bottom to the top of the parent element
}


// flex-flow  - declared on flex containers.
// Used to declare both the flex-wrap and flex-direction properties in one line.
.container {
    display: flex;
    flex-flow: column wrap;
}


// flex-grow - declared on flex it ems.
// The flex-grow property specifies how much of the remaining space in the flex container should be assigned to the item (the default value is 0).
// The flex-grow property accepts a number as a value.
// The higher the number, the more space the item will take up.
.child {
    flex-grow: 1; // the item will take up all of the remaining space in the container
    flex-grow: 2; // the item will take up twice as much space as an item with a value of 1
}


// flex-shrink - declared on flex items.
// The flex-shrink property specifies how much the item will shrink relative to the other items in the container (the default value is 1).
// The flex-shrink property accepts a number as a value.
// The higher the number, the more the item will shrink.
.child {
    flex-shrink: 1; // the item will shrink to fit the container
    flex-shrink: 2; // the item will shrink twice as much as an item with a value of 1
}


// flex-basis - declared on flex items.
// The flex-basis property specifies the initial size of the item before any space is distributed according to the flex-grow and flex-shrink properties.
// The flex-basis property accepts a length value (px, em, etc.) or a percentage as a value.
// The default value is auto, which means the item will be sized according to its content.
.child {
    flex-basis: 100px; // the item will be 100 pixels wide
    flex-basis: 50%; // the item will be 50% of the width of the container
}
// flex-basis: auto; // the item will be sized according to its content


// flex - declared on flex items.
// The flex property is a shorthand property for the flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis properties.
// The flex property accepts one, two, or three values.
// The first value is the flex-grow value, the second value is the flex-shrink value, and the third value is the flex-basis value.
.child {
    flex: 1; // the item will take up all of the remaining space in the container
    flex: 1 0 auto; // the item will take up all of the remaining space in the container, will not shrink, and be sized according to its content
    flex: 1 1 200px; // the item will take up all of the remaining space in the container, shrink to fit the container, and be 200 pixels wide
    flex: 1 2 100px; // the item will take up all of the remaining space in the container, shrink twice as much as an item with a value of 1, and be 100 pixels wide
    flex: 1 2 auto; // the item will take up all of the remaining space in the container, shrink twice as much as an item with a value of 1, and be sized according to its content
}
