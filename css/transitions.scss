// TRANSITIONS 

// 1. transition-duration 
a {
    transition-property: color; // Property we want to transition
    transition-duration: 1s; //The duration of the transition
}


// 2. transition-timing-function -  Describes the pace of the transition 
a {
    transition-property: color; 
    transition-duration: 1s; 
    transition-timing-function: ease; // default - starts slowly, speeds up in the middle, slows down again at the end
    transition-timing-function: ease-in; // starts slow, accelerates quickly, stops abruptly 
    transition-timing-function: ease-out;  // begins abruptly, slows down, and ends slowly
    transition-timing-function: ease-in-out;  // starts slow, gets fast in the middle, and ends slowly
    transition-timing-function: linear;  // constant speed throughout
}


// 3. transition-delay -  pecifies the time to wait before starting the transition
a {
    transition-property: width;
    transition-duration: 0.5s;
    transition-delay: 0.2s; 
}


// 4. transition -  shorthand for the 3 properties above 
a {
    transition: color 1.5s linear 0.5s; // transition-property, transition-duration, transition-timing-function, transition-delay.
}


// 5. Combinations
