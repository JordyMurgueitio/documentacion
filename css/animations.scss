// ANIMATIONS 




// 1. Keyframes - define what the animation looks like at each stage of the animation timeline

@keyframes bounceIn {
    0% {  //  1st stage (0%), the element is at opacity 0 and scaled down to 10 percent of its default size
    transform: scale(0.1);
    opacity: 0;
    }
    60% {   // 2nd stage (60%) the element fades in to full opacity and grows to 120 percent of its default size
    transform: scale(1.2);
    opacity: 1;
    }
    100% {
    transform: scale(1);  // final stage (100%), it scales down slightly and returns to its default size.
    }
}

@keyframes example {  // this animation changes background-color and position of an element
    0%   {background-color:red; left:0px; top:0px;}
    25%  {background-color:yellow; left:200px; top:0px;}
    50%  {background-color:blue; left:200px; top:200px;}
    75%  {background-color:green; left:0px; top:200px;}
    100% {background-color:red; left:0px; top:0px;}
}



// 2. Animation properties - assign the @keyframes to the elements that you want to animate, define how it is animated

div {
    animation-name: bounceIn;  //The name of the animation, defined in the @keyframes
    animation-duration: 2s;  // duration of the animation
}


// 2.1 animation-timing-function - defines the speed curve or pace of the animation
div {
    animation-name: bounceIn;  
    animation-duration: 2s;
    animation-timing-function: ease;   //Specifies an animation with a slow start, then fast, then end slowly (this is default)
    animation-timing-function: linear;  //Specifies an animation with the same speed from start to end
    animation-timing-function: ease-in;  //Specifies an animation with a slow start
    animation-timing-function: ease-out;  // Specifies an animation with a slow end
    animation-timing-function: ease-in-out;  //Specifies an animation with a slow start and end
}


// 2.2 animation-delay - allows you to specify when the animation (or pieces of the animation) will start

div {
    animation-name: example;
    animation-duration: 4s;
    animation-delay: 2s;  // sets a 2 seconds delay before starting the animation
}


// 2.3 animation-iteration-count - specifies the number of times that the animation will play
