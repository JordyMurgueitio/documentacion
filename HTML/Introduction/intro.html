<!-- document type declaration-->
It tells the browser what type of document to expect, along with what version of HTML is being used in the document 
<!DOCTYPE html>

<!-- The HTML tag-->
To create HTML structure and content, we must add opening and closing <html> tags after declaring <!DOCTYPE html>
<html></html>


<!-- The head element -->
The <head> element contains the metadata for a web page
<head></head>

<!-- The title -->
A browser's tab displays the title specified in the <title> tag. The <title> tag is always inside of the <head>


<!-- Headings -->
The following is the list of heading elements available in HTML. They are ordered from largest to smallest in size.
<h1> â€” used for main headings. All other smaller headings are used for subheadings.
<h2>
<h3>
<h4>
<h5>
<h6>

<!-- Divs -->
These sections are very useful for grouping elements in your HTML together.
<div>s don't inherently have a visual representation, but they are very useful when we want to apply custom styles to our HTML elements.
<body>
    <div>
        <h1>Why use divs?</h1>
        <p>Great for grouping elements!</p>
    </div>
</body>


<!-- Attributes -->
Attributes can be added to the opening tag of an HTML element to change its default behavior or provide additional data about it.
From providing information to changing styling
<div id="intro">
    <h1>Introduction</h1>
</div>


<!-- Displaying text -->
If you want to display text in HTML, you can use a paragraph or span:
<p></p> Contains and displays a block of text that defines a paragraph.
<span></span> Used for grouping related text or elements for styling and scripting.


<!-- Styling text -->
The <em> tag will generally render as italic emphasis.
The <strong> will generally render as bold emphasis.

<p><strong>The Nile River</strong> is the <em>longest</em> river in the world, 
measuring over 6,850 kilometers long (approximately 4,260 miles).</p>


<!-- Line Breaks -->
The line break element is only composed of a starting tag. 
You can use it anywhere within your HTML code and a line break will be shown in the browser.
<br>


<!-- Unordered Lists -->
Create a list of items in no particular order.
Individual list items must be added to the unordered list using the <li> tag.
<ul>
    <li>Limes</li>
    <li>Tortillas</li>
    <li>Chicken</li>
</ul>      


<!-- Ordered Lists -->
Each list item is numbered.
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.</li>
    <li>Mix whole wheat flour, baking soda, and salt.</li>
    <li>Cream the butter, sugar in separate bowl.</li>
</ol>


<!-- Images -->
The <img> tag allows you to add an image to a web page.
The <img> tag is a self-closing tag. 
Required attribute called "src". The src attribute must be set to the image's source, or the location of the image.
We should also include the "alt" attribute. 
<img src="image-location.jpg" alt="company-building" />


<!-- Videos -->
The <video> element requires a "src" attribute with a link to the video source.
The "width" and "height" attributes are used to set the size of the video displayed in the browser. 
The "controls" attribute instructs the browser to include basic video controls such as pausing and playing.

<video src="myVideo.mp4" width="320" height="240" controls>
    Video not supported
</video>
