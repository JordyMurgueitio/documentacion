<!-- Aside element -->
<aside> is used to mark additional information that can enhance another element,but isn't required in order to understand the main content.


<!-- Figure and Figcaption -->
<figure> is an element used to encapsulate media such as an image, illustration, diagram, code snippet, etc,
<figcaption> is an element used to describe the media in the <figure> tag.
Usually, <figcaption> will go inside <figure>.

<figure>
    <img src="overwatch.jpg">
    <figcaption>This picture shows characters from Overwatch.</figcaption>
</figure>    



<!-- ARIA role -->
The ARIA role attribute is used to define the role of an element in a web application.
The value of an element's role changes how a screen reader communicates the element
<div id="code-editor" role="complementary">
    ...
</div>



<!-- ARIA role: Presentation -->
We can instruct screen readers to skip reading unnecessary elements by setting the role attribute to presentation
<ol role="presentation">
    <li>List Item 1</li>
    <li>List Item 2</li>
</ol>
- A screen reader will not read the element's name (“ordered list”)
- Adding role="presentation" to an <ol> tag will cause the screen reader to skip 
directly to the text between the <li> tags (it will not read the names of the <li> elements).



<!-- ARIA properties -->   
ARIA properties are attributes that you can add to HTML elements.
The property aria-label gives the screen reader additional information to read out loud to the user
<img src="#" alt="A painting of the Shenandoah Valley"/>
<p aria-label="Artist">Armand Cabrera, 2010</p>



<!-- The alt attribute -->
The alt attribute is used to describe an image (or several other elements). 
A screen reader will read the value of the alt attribute out loud
<img src="#" alt="a kitten snuggling a puppy"/>

When using the alt attribute, you should adhere to these conventions:

1. In general, the value of alt should concisely describe the image.
2. For images that are also <a> elements, the alt attribute should describe the source that the link targets.
3. If an image conveys no information (such as a decorative border), the alt attribute should be empty, but should never be omitted.
4. If an image is described by text near the image, do not duplicate the description in the alt attribute. Use an empty alt attribute instead.
