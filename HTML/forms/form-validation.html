<!-- FORM VALIDATION -->

<!-- server-side validation -->
This happens when data is sent to another machine (typically a server) for validation.
An example of this type of validation is the usage of a login page


<!-- client-side validation -->
We use it when we want to check the data on the browser (the client). This validation occurs before data is sent to the server
It saves us time from having to send information to the server and wait for the server to send back confirmation or rejection of the data



<!-- Requiring an input -->
There are fields in our <form>s which are not optional
We can add the "required" attribute to an <input> element.
<form action="/example.html" method="POST">
    <label for="allergies">Do you have any dietary restrictions?</label>
    <br>
    <input id="allergies" name="allergies" type="text" required>
    <br>
    <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>


<!-- Set a minimum and maximum -->
Assign a minimum or maximum value for a number field e.g. <input type="number"> and <input type="range">
To set a minimum acceptable value, we assign the "min" attribute a value. 
To set a maximum acceptable value, we assign the "max" attribute a value.
<form action="/example.html" method="POST">
    <label for="guests">Enter # of guests:</label>
    <input id="guests" name="guests" type="number" min="1" max="4">
    <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>



<!-- Checking text length -->
To set a minimum number of characters for a text field, we add the "minlength" attribute and a value 
To set a maximum number of characters for a text field, we add the "maxlength" attribute and a value
<form action="/example.html" method="POST">
    <label for="summary">Summarize your feelings in less than 250 characters</label>
    <input id="summary" name="summary" type="text" minlength="5" maxlength="250" required>
    <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>


<!-- Matching a pattern -->
When we want user input to follow specific guidelines, we use the "pattern" attribute and assign it a regular expression, or regex.
Regular expressions are a sequence of characters that make up a search pattern
Let's say we wanted to check for a valid credit card number (a 14 to 16 digit number). We could use the regex: [0-9]{14,16}
<form action="/example.html" method="POST">
    <label for="payment">Credit Card Number (no spaces):</label>
    <br>
    <input id="payment" name="payment" type="text" required pattern="[0-9]{14,16}">
    <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
