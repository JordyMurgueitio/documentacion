Git offers a few eraser-like features that allow us to undo mistakes during project creation


<!-- head commit -->
<!-- the commit you are currently on is known as the HEAD commit -->
<!-- To see the HEAD commit, enter: -->
git show HEAD


<!-- git checkout -->
<!-- Discards changes in the working directory -->
<!-- will restore the file in your working directory to look exactly as it did when you last made a commit -->
git checkout HEAD filename 


<!-- git reset -->
<!-- Unstages file changes in the staging area -->
<!-- It does not discard file changes from the working directory, it just removes them from the staging area. -->
git reset HEAD filename


git reset commit_SHA
<!--Resets to a previous commit in your commit history -->
<!-- works by using the first 7 characters of the SHA of a previous commit -->



<!-- git stash -->
<!-- will store your work temporarily for later use in a hidden directory -->
<!-- It is useful when you want to switch branches but have uncommitted changes in your working directory -->
git stash 
<!-- to retrieve the code you were working on previously, you can “pop” the work that was stored when you used git stash. -->
git stash pop 
<!-- From here, you can continue your work and commit it when ready -->



<!-- git log -->
<!-- shows the commit history of the current branch -->
git log

<!-- git log -S "keyword" -->
<!-- searches the commit history for a specific keyword -->
git log -S "add" <!-- find any commits where the 'add' keyword was used -->

<!-- git log --oneline --graph -->
<!-- visual representation of how the branches and commits were created -->
<!-- shows the commit history in a more compact format -->
git log --oneline --graph




<!-- git commit --ammend -->
<!-- allows you to modify the last commit -->
<!-- This is useful if you forgot to add a file or want to change the commit message -->
git commit --ammend   
<!-- This will open the commit message in your default text editor, allowing you to modify it -->
