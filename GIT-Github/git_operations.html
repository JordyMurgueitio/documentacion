Git offers a few eraser-like features that allow us to undo mistakes during project creation


<!-- head commit -->
<!-- the commit you are currently on is known as the HEAD commit -->
<!-- To see the HEAD commit, enter: -->
git show HEAD


<!-- git checkout -->
<!-- Discards changes in the working directory -->
<!-- will restore the file in your working directory to look exactly as it did when you last made a commit -->
git checkout HEAD filename 


<!-- git reset -->
<!-- Unstages file changes in the staging area -->
<!-- It does not discard file changes from the working directory, it just removes them from the staging area. -->
git reset HEAD filename


git reset commit_SHA
<!--Resets to a previous commit in your commit history -->
<!-- works by using the first 7 characters of the SHA of a previous commit -->
