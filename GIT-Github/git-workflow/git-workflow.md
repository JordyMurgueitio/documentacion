# Basic GIT workflow

## 1. git init

The word **init** means initialize. The command sets up all the tools Git needs to begin tracking changes made to the project.

## 2. git workflow

A Git project can be thought of as having three parts:

1. A Working Directory: where you’ll be doing all the work: creating, editing, deleting and organizing files
2. A Staging Area: where you’ll list changes you make to the working directory
3. A Repository: where Git permanently stores those changes as different versions of the project

The Git workflow consists of editing files in the working directory, adding files to the staging area, and saving changes to a Git repository
