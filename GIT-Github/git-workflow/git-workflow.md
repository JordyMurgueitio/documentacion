![alt text](git-workflow.png)

The Git workflow consists of editing files in the working directory, adding files to the staging area, and saving changes to a Git repository

1. **git init**
The word **init** means initialize. The command sets up all the tools Git needs to begin tracking changes made to the project.
2. git status
3. git add
