<!-- cd - change directoy -->
cd new-directory   <!-- Changes to the directory "new-directory" -->
cd..    <!-- Changes to the directory above the csurrent working directory. -->
cd 2015/jan/memory   <!-- The relative path is a forward slash (/) separated list of all the directories leading to the goal directory. -->
$ cd ../..   <!-- can be read: the directory above and the directory above that. -->


<!-- mkdir - make directory -->
Creates a new directory in the current working directory.


<!-- touch -->
