<!-- GIT -->
Git works by recording the changes you make to a project, 
storing those changes, then allowing you to reference them as needed


<!-- git init -->
<!-- This command sets up all the tools Git needs to begin tracking changes made to the project -->
git init 



<!-- Git Workflow -->
The Git workflow consists of editing files in the working directory, 
adding files to the staging area, and saving changes to a Git repository
<!-- A Git project can be thought of as having three parts:
        1. A Working Directory: where you’ll be doing all the work: creating, editing, deleting and organizing files
        2. A Staging Area: where you’ll list changes you make to the working directory
        3. A Repository: where Git permanently stores those changes as different versions of the project -->



<!-- git status -->
<!-- Show you which files have been changed, which files are staged, and which files are untracked -->
git status


<!-- git add -->
<!-- This command adds files to the staging area -->
git add <filename>

<!-- git add . -->
<!-- This command adds all files in the working directory to the staging area -->
git add .



<!-- git diff -->
<!-- check the differences between the working directory and the staging area -->
git diff filename



<!-- git commit -->
<!-- A commit permanently stores changes from the staging area inside the repository -->
git commit -m "Complete first line of dialogue"
<!-- The -m flag allows you to add a message to the commit -->


<!-- git log -->
<!-- This command shows a list of all the commits made to the repository -->
Refer back to an earlier version of a project
Commits can be viewed with git log
git log
