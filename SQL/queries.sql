/* Keyword in SQL that allows you to rename a column or table using an alias
It's best practice to surround your aliases with single quotes 
When using AS, the columns are not being renamed in the table. The aliases only appear in the result */

/* Used to return unique values in the output. 
It filters out all duplicate values in the specified column(s). */

Filters the result set to only include rows where the given condition is true */

/* Useful operator when you want to compare similar values
Special operator used with the WHERE clause to search for a specific pattern in a column */

/* used in a WHERE clause to filter the result set within a certain range. 
It accepts two values that are either numbers, text or dates 
When the values are text, it filters the result set for within the alphabetical range */
